## Day 1 - Sketches and Research (2 hours)

Lots of research. Started by looking at X printer V2 design gallery, and reading build logs. Took a look at X printer and Lemontron's CAD models. Started sketching out ideas. 

Extruder design was an initial issue. It is difficult to obtain a 90-degree hotend, so hotend will have to be as flat as possible with off-the-shelf parts. We will see how that goes. Motion design for XY is still undecided, needs more thinking. Currently sticking to a single-carriage design.

Build should be mostly 3D Printed with off-the-shelf metal parts where possible (like rails). It should be replicable.

Current plan is to have a bed above and controls for all 3 axes on the bottom. This will greatly reduce the strain on lifting the Z-axis.
